ssh {user}@{host}

on a server we may have to do "sudo apt-get install git" to install git
may have to do "sudo apt-get install nodejs"

How SSH works:

- Symmetrical Encryption
-- Uses one secret key for encryption/decryption
-- Each key is unique for each session
-- Key Exchange Algorithm (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)
-- Problems:
--- Anyone who has the key can decrypt

- Asymmetrical Encryption
-- required for Key Exchange Algorithm
-- use of private and public keys

- Hashing
-- Using a hash function
-- Host decrypts using symmetric key, packet sequence #, and content
-- Host then reruns hash function on content and compares the two hashes


1. Diffie-Helmman Key Exchange
2. Arrive at Symmetric Key
3. Make sure of no funny business
4. Authenticate user

Folder:
~/.ssh

Generate public/private key pairs:
ssh-keygen -C "email@email.com"

shh-add ~/.ssh/your_id_rsa

public keys will have .pub, private keys will not

copy key into authorized_keys on your server
